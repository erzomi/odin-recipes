        <h2>Descritpion</h2>
        <p><strong>Perfect pancakes</strong> make the morning better and are a quick fix if you prepare the recipe and freeze it for when in need.</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more for serving</li>

        </ul>
        <p><h2>Preparation</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving.</li>
            <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.</li>
            <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</li>
        </ol>
