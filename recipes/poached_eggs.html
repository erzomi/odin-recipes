    <h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p><strong>Poached eggs</strong> are an easy and quick go-to for a good start in the morning.</p>
    <p>Here's a new and improved version of our poached egg method. Nothing too complicated here; we pretty much poach eggs like everybody else, except we've got a little step in the middle that makes it easier if you're doing this for a larger group.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon champagne vinegar</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, as <em>fresh</em> as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Preparation</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Fill a bowl with ice water.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over medium heat; stir in vinegar and salt. Bring to a gentle, slow simmer and reduce heat to low.</p></li>
        <li><p>Break each egg into a separate small ramekin; place a ramekin close to the surface of the water and gently pour egg into the simmering water. Let egg white set for a minute or two and use a silicone spatula to gently lift egg from the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Cook until white is firm and yolk is runny, about 6 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lift poached egg from water using a slotted spoon and transfer gently to bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Reheat eggs for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes in very gently simmering water and remove with a slotted spoon. Tap bottom of slotted spoon containing egg on a dry paper towel to remove any excess water before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
