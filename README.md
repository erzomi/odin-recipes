# odin-recipes

This is the first project from the odin projectÂ´s foundation course.

odin-recipes will be a basic .html website that will be used later with CSS and Java-Script to learn web development.

With finishig this project I demonstrate using the CLI, working with Git and GitHub, creating a html boilerplate, using lists in html, using links (relative and absolute), using pictures of different formats and performing atomic commits via Git.

All of which I did not know how to use a couple days ago.

Happy coding!
